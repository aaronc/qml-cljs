# {{name}}

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Quick Start for using QML and Clojurescript

1. Make sure you have Qt 5.3 or higher installed: http://qt-project.org/downloads
2. Execute `lein cljsbuild once`
3. Execute `lein repl`
4. From the Clojure REPL, execute `(qml-cljs-repl)`
5. Open `{{sanitized}}.pro` in Qt Creator
6. Run or Debug the project
7. If all goes well, the Clojurescript REPL should connect! You should
   try executing something simple like `(+ 1 2)` to make sure you get
   a response.
